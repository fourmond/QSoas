Compilation requires the following packages:

  * a Ruby interpreter, from http://ruby-lang.org
  * Qt4 libraries (DO NOT USE QT5, there are subtle differences,
    and some features won't work), from http://qt-project.org/
  * the GSL libraries, from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

On mac and linux computers, just running

  ./configure

and

  make

should do the trick.

On windows, that should do the trick too, provided the GSL, Qt and
Ruby libraries are in a place where the linker can find it.
