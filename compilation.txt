Compilation requires the following packages:

  * a Ruby interpreter, from http://ruby-lang.org.
    All versions from ruby 1.9 to 2.1 are known to work, but as of
    now, ruby 2.2 is not supported
  * Qt4 libraries (DO NOT USE QT5, there are subtle differences,
    and some features jsut won't work), from http://qt-project.org/
  * the GSL libraries, from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
  

On mac and linux computers, just running

  ./configure

and

  make

should do the trick.

On windows, that should do the trick too, provided the GSL, Qt and
Ruby libraries are in a place where the linker can find it.


As of version 2.0, on Windows, ruby 1.9 is no longer supported
