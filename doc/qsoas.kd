**Important warning**
Some commands of `QSoas` may not be documented here. It means they are
not supported in any way: their syntax may change without notice, they
may disappear, they may turn out to do completely different things in
the end. In short, **use them at your own risks** (and it would be a
good idea to check out the code, in that case).


# Commands, arguments and options (how to read this document)

QSoas works by entering commands inside the command prompt.

Most commands have arguments and options. Arguments and options are
separated by spaces:

~~~ 
QSoas> command argument1 argument2 "argument 3" /option=option /option2="with spaces"
~~~

If you need to pass arguments or option values that have spaces, make
sure you quote them using `"` or `'`, like in the above example.

Arguments are indicated like _that_ in the documentation below. You
need to provide all the arguments for a command to work. Some
arguments are followed by _..._, which means that you can pass several
space-separated arguments. This is the case for [cmd: load],
for instance:

~~~
QSoas> load file1 file2 file3
~~~

Some options are marked as "(default option)", which means that, if all
arguments of the command are already specified, you can omit the
`/option=` part of the option. For instance, to set the
[cmd: temperature] to 300 K, you should be doing that:

~~~
QSoas> temperature /set=300
~~~

But, as `/set` is the default option, you can omit the `/set=` and
write:

~~~
QSoas> temperature 300
~~~

In this documentation, all options and arguments have mouseover texts
that give a short explanation of what kind of values are expected.

Some commands can be used through a short name (like `q` for
[cmd: quit]), indicated as such in the present documentation.

Some commands are marked as *(interactive)*. This means that their use
requires user interaction, which in particular makes them not
desirable for using inside [scripts](#scripting), even if it actually
is possible (but then, the script has to pause for user interaction to
happen).

## Note about text files {#text-files}

Many commands of QSoas make use of "plain text files", i.e. files that
simply contain unformatted text. These are for instance:

 * files for defining fits with [cmd: load-fits]
 * scripts to be run with [cmd: run]
 * definitions of kinetic systems for
  [cmd: fit-kinetic-system]
 * even saved fit parameters are plain text files

On windows, use Notepad to edit them. On Linux, `pico`, `nano`, `vi`
or `emacs` are pretty good choices. On MacOS, use TextEdit, but make sure
you hit Cmd+Shift+T to switch to "plain text" format; the default is
rich text (i.e. text with formatting informations) in the RTF format,
and `QSoas` does not understand RTF.


## Buffer list arguments {#buffer-lists}

Many commands, such as [cmd: flag], [cmd: contract] and so on take
lists of buffers (or datasets) as arguments. This list can take
several forms:

 * A comma-separated of buffer numbers (the ones given by 
   [cmd: show-stack]), such as: `1,4,7` (0 is the current buffer, 1,
   the one just before, which you can reach using [cmd: undo], etc.).
 * Negative numbers refer to the "redo" stack: `-1` is the buffer you
   would get by running [cmd: redo]
 * A number range, such as `1..7`, meaning all buffers from 1 to 7
   included.
 * A number range with a step, such as `1..7:3`, meaning `1,4,7`.
 * `all` for all buffers on the stack.
 * `displayed` for the currently displayed buffers.
 * `latest` for the datasets produced by the last command (running a
   script count as many commands)
 * `latest:1` is the same as `latest`, `latest:2` represents the
   datasets produced by the command before the last one, etc...

It is also possible to make use of buffer flags set by [cmd: flag]:

 * `flagged` stands for all flagged buffers (regardless of the name of
   the flag);
 * `unflagged` for all buffers that don't have a flag;
 * `flagged-` and `unflagged-` do the same, but with the buffers in
   the reverse order;
 * `flagged:`_flagname_ for all buffers that have the flag _flagname_;
 * `unflagged:`_flagname_ for all buffers that don't have the flag
   _flagname_;
 * and the variants `flagged-:`_flagname_ and `unflagged-:`_flagname_
   for the reversed order.

## Buffer columns {#column-names}

Some commands such as [cmd: bin] take as arguments or options buffer
column names. There are three way to designate those:

 * using a number: `1` is the $$x$$ column, `2` is the $$y$$ column,
   and so on
 * using a number prefixed by `#`: this is a 0-based index, `#0` is
   then the $$x$$ column
 * by its name: `x`, `y`, `z`, `y2`, `y3` and so on. `y2` is
   equivalent to `z`
 * `no` or `none` when you don't want to specify a number at all, such
   as for disabling the display of error bars with
   [cmd: dataset-options].

Some commands (like [cmd: contract]) take column lists, which are
comma-separated lists of columns (just like above), with the addition
of range: `2..6` are columns 2 to 6 inclusive.

Exits QSoas, losing all of the current session. Keep in mind, though,
that the full log of the session is always available in the
`soas.log` file created in the initial directory, which is indicated in
the very beginning in the terminal.

To avoid accumulating very large log files, the log file gets renamed
as `soas.log.1` when you start QSoas (and the older one as
`soas.log.2`, and so on until `soas.log.5`).

{::comment} description-start: print {:/}
Prints the current view, providing a usual print dialog. If you just
want a PDF or PostScript file, just provide the file name as the
`/file` option.

An optional title can be added using the `/title` option.

**Important note:** please keep in mind that QSoas is not designed to
be a data plotting system, it is a data analysis system. So plotting
capacities don't go far...
{::comment} description-end: print {:/}


{::comment} synopsis-start: define-alias {:/}

### define-alias - Define alias {#cmd-define-alias}

`define-alias` _alias_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"} _command_{:title="the name of one of QSoas's commands"} `/*=`_text_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"}

{::comment} synopsis-end: define-alias {:/}
{::comment} description-start: define-alias {:/}
The `define-alias` commands allows one to defined a shortcut for a
command one uses often with the same options. For instance, running:

~~~~
QSoas> define-alias fit-2exp fit-exponential-decay /exponentials=2 /loss=true
~~~~

creates a `fit-2exp` command that is equivalent to starting 
[cmd: fit-exponential-decay] with two exponentials by default
and film loss on. 

The `/*` option above means "any option".

Alias can only be used to provide default values for options. It
cannot provide default values for arguments.

### display-aliases - Display aliases {#cmd-display-aliases}

`display-aliases` 


{::comment} synopsis-end: display-aliases {:/}
{::comment} description-start: display-aliases {:/}
Shows a list of all the currently defined aliases.
{::comment} description-end: display-aliases {:/}

{::comment} synopsis-start: graphics-settings {:/}

### graphics-settings - Graphics settings {#cmd-graphics-settings}

  * `/antialias=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: Turns on/off the use of antialised graphics -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`

{::comment} synopsis-end: graphics-settings {:/}
{::comment} description-start: graphics-settings {:/}
Gives the possibility to tweak a few settings concerning display. The
settings are persistent and kept from one QSoas session until the next
one.

Turning on antialias (with `/antialias=true`) will make QSoas use
antialiased drawings, which looks admittedly nicer, but requires much
more computation time, to the point that drawing jagged curves may
become particularly slow. Printing or exporting to PDF files through
[cmd: print] always produces antialiased graphics, regardless of this
option.

If you experience performance problems for displaying curves, use
`/opengl=true`, as this will instruct QSoas to use hardware
acceleration to display curves, which should greatly enhance the
display speed. It is off by default as some setups do not really
benefit from that, and moreover OpenGL support is sometimes buggy and
may result in crashes.

{::comment} synopsis-start: ruby-run {:/}

### ruby-run - Ruby load {#cmd-ruby-run}

`ruby-run` _file_{:title="path of a file"}

  * _file_{:title="path of a file"}: Ruby file to load -- values: path of a file

{::comment} synopsis-end: ruby-run {:/}
{::comment} description-start: ruby-run {:/}
This command loads and executes a [Ruby](#ruby) file. For the time being, the
main interest of this command is to define complex functions in a
separate file. 

Imagine you have a file `function.rb` containing the text:

~~~~
def mm(x,vmax,km)
  return vmax/(1 + km/x)
end
~~~~

After running 

~~~~
QSoas> ruby-run function.rb
~~~~

You can use `mm` like any normal function for fitting:

~~~~
QSoas> fit-arb mm(x,vmax,km)
~~~~

{::comment} synopsis-start: system {:/}

### system - System {#cmd-system}

`system` _command..._{:title="one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc..."} `/shell=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"} `/timeout=`_integer_{:title="an integer"}

  * _command..._{:title="one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc..."}: Arguments of the command  -- values: one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc...
  * `/shell=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: Use shell -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`
  * `/timeout=`_integer_{:title="an integer"}: Timeout (in milliseconds) -- values: an integer

{::comment} synopsis-end: system {:/}
{::comment} description-start: system {:/}
The `system` command can be used to run external commands from
QSoas. The output of the commands will be displayed in the terminal.
{::comment} description-end: system {:/}

{::comment} synopsis-start: timer {:/}

### timer - Timer {#cmd-timer}

`timer` 


{::comment} synopsis-end: timer {:/}
{::comment} description-start: timer {:/}
The first call starts a timer, and the second one stops it, showing
the amount of time that has elapsed since the previous call to
[cmd: timer]. This can be used to benchmark costly computations, for
instance.
{::comment} description-end: timer {:/}


## Output file manipulation {#output-file}

Several commands (e.g.  various data analysis commands and the fit
commands) write data to the output file.

By default, the first time the output file is used, a `output.dat`
file is created in the current directory. Another file can be used by
providing its name to the [cmd: output] command.

{::comment} synopsis-start: output {:/}

### output - Change output file {#cmd-output}

`output` `/file=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/overwrite=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"} `/reopen=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"} `/meta=`_texts_{:title="several texts, separated by ','"}

  * `/file=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} (default option): Name of the new output file -- values: path of a file
  * `/overwrite=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: If on, overwrite the file instead of appending -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`
  * `/reopen=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: If on, forces reopening the file -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`
  * `/meta=`_texts_{:title="several texts, separated by ','"}: When writing to output file, also print the listed meta-data -- values: several texts, separated by ','

{::comment} synopsis-end: output {:/}
{::comment} description-start: output {:/}
This command has several modes of operations. If _file_ is provided
(it is the default option, so you can omit `/file=`), then it opens
_file_ as the new output file. By default, if the file exists, new
data are appended, and the old data are left untouched. You can force
overwriting by specifiying `/overwrite=true`.

In the other mode, when only the `/meta` option is provided, it sets
the list of meta-data that will automatically be added to the output
file when outputting any data there. It is a comma-separated list of
meta names. See more about meta-data [there](#meta-data).

It is a bad idea to modify the output file while QSoas is still using
it, as it messes up what QSoas think is in the output file. If that
happens, use

~~~~
QSoas> output /reopen=true
~~~~

{::comment} description-end: output {:/}

{::comment} synopsis-start: comment {:/}

### comment - Write line to output {#cmd-comment}

`comment` _comment_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"}

  * _comment_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"}: Comment line added to output file -- values: arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance

{::comment} synopsis-end: comment {:/}
{::comment} description-start: comment {:/}
Writes the given line _comment_ to the output file. Don't forget to
quote if you need to include spaces:

~~~~
QSoas> comment 'Switching to sample 2'
~~~~
{::comment} description-end: comment {:/}




# Data loading/saving

The main command for loading data is [cmd: load]

{::comment} synopsis-start: load {:/}

### load - Load {#cmd-load}

{::comment} synopsis-end: load {:/}
{::comment} description-start: load {:/}

Loads the given files and push them onto the data stack. QSoas
features several backends for loading files (``backends'' are roughly
equivalent to ``file formats''). In principle, QSoas is
smart enough to figure out which one is the correct one, but you can
force a given backend by using the appropriate `load-as-`
command. Using a backend directly also provides more control on the
way files are loaded (this can also be done via the numerous options
to `load`, which are forwarded to the appropriate backend). Currently
available backends:

 * [`text`](#cmd-load-as-text) for plain space-separated text
 * [`csv`](#cmd-load-as-csv) for CSV data
 * [`chi`](#cmd-load-as-chi) for file from CH Instruments potentiostats

Look in their documentation for more information. QSoas tells you
which backend it used for loading a given file:

~~~~
QSoas> load 03.dat
Loading file: './03.dat' using backend text
~~~~

The command `load` caches the loaded file. If for some reason, the
cache gets in the way, use the direct `load-as-` commands, or
alternatively use `/ignore-cache=true`.

`load`, together with all the other commands that take several files
as arguments understand unix-like wildcards:

~~~~
QSoas> load *.dat
~~~~

This command loads all the `.dat` files from the current directory.

~~~~
QSoas> load [0-4]*.dat
~~~~

This loads only those that start with a digit from 0 to 4, etc.

The `load` command and the corresponding `load-as-` command makes it
possible to set dataset options just as with 
[cmd: dataset-options], see that command for more informations.

The style option sets the color style when loading several curves:

~~~~
QSoas> load *.dat /style=red-blue
~~~~

This loads all the `.dat` files in the current directory, and displays
them with a color gradient from red (for the first loaded file) to
blue (for the last loaded file). This makes it very easy to follow
subtle modifications from one data file to the next.

The `/flags=` option makes it possible to flag buffers as they get

Load any number of files using the backend `text`, bypassing cache and
automatic backend detection. `text` recognises space-separated data
(which includes tab-separated data). Most "plain text" files will be
recognized by this backend. By default, it loads all the columns of
the file, but only displays the second as a function of the first. If
you want to work on other columns, have a look at [cmd: expand].
Alternatively, you can specify the columns to load using the
`/columns` option, see below.

Apart from the options of [cmd: dataset-options] and the `/style` and
`/flags` options documented above, the `text` backend accepts several
options controlling the way the text files are interpreted:

  * `/separator` is the text that separate the columns (blank space by
    default. You can use [Qt regular
    expressions](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qregexp.html#introduction)
    enclosed by `/`, such as: `/[;,]/` to split columns on semicolon
    or commas.
  * `/decimal` is the decimal separator (default is the dot).
  * `/comments` is a regular expression describing comment lines (ie
    lines that get ignored). By default, line that don't start
    by a number are ignored.
  * Give to `/skip` a number of text lines that should be ignored at
    the beginning of the text file.
  * If `/auto-split` is `true`, then `QSoas` will create a new dataset
    everytime it hits a series of blank lines in the file.
  * `/columns` is a series of numbers saying in which order the file
    columns will be used to make a dataset. For instance,
    `/columns=2,1` will swap X and Y at load time.

The `csv` backend is essentially the same backend as the
[`text`](#cmd-load-as-text) one, but with the separators set by
default to commas and semicolons, to parse CSV files. 
Hence, the options have the same
meaning as for [cmd: load-as-text].

If a buffer contains several columns, QSoas only displays the second as a
function of the first. [cmd: expand] splits the current buffer into as
many buffers as there are Y columns, ie a X, Y1, Y2, Y3 buffer will be
split into three buffers: X, Y1;   X, Y2 and  X, Y3.

If `/perp-meta` is specified, then the given [meta-data](#meta-data)
will be defined for each buffer, based on the value of the
[perpendicular coordinates](#meta-data). In any case, the
perpendicular coordinates are kept.

Saves the designated buffers to file.

Unlike the [cmd: save] command, this saves the buffers using
their current name, and does not prompt for a file name. It is
probably a good idea to use [cmd: rename] first, or use the
possibilities below.

This command can rename the buffers before saving them,
by using a `printf`-like format, such as in the following case,
which renames the first 101 buffers to `Buffer-000.dat`,
`Buffer-001.dat`, and so on:

~~~
QSoas> save-buffers /format=Buffer-%03d.dat 0..100
~~~

It is also possible to use a full-blown [Ruby](#ruby) expression that
will be aware of the buffer's meta-data:

~~~
QSoas> save-buffers '/expression="File-#{$meta["sr"]}.dat"'
~~~

This requires careful quoting: outer single quotes (`'`) for QSoas and
inner double quotes for [Ruby](#ruby). See more information about the
informations available from the ruby code [there](#for-which).

If you only need to rename the buffers without saving them, use
`/mode=rename`.

# Data stack manipulation

Data files are loaded and manipulated in a stack. Every time a file is
loaded or a buffer modified, the new buffer is pushed onto the top of
the stack, and becomes the current buffer (numbered 0). Older buffers
have increasing numbers (the previous buffer is 1, the one before 2,
and so on). There is also a "redo" stack populated by the
[cmd: undo] command. Stack can be manipulated in different
ways:

 * the current buffer can be changed using
   [cmd: undo]/[cmd: redo];
 * buffers can be permanently removed from the stack using
   [cmd: drop];
 * the whole stack can be saved for later use with
   [cmd: save-stack] and restored using
   [cmd: load-stack], or dropped altogether using
   [cmd: clear-stack];
 * contents of the stack can be displayed in the terminal using
   [cmd: show-stack] or in a dialog bog with 
   [cmd: browse-stack].
 * an old buffer can be put back on the top of the stack with
   [cmd: fetch].
 * buffers can be flagged ([cmd: flag]) or unflagged
   ([cmd: unflag]) to be used later using the `flagged`
   buffer selector.

{::comment} synopsis-end: flag {:/}
{::comment} description-start: flag {:/}
Flags the given buffer (or the current one if none is supplied) for
later use. All currently flagged buffers can be specified using the
`flagged` argument to, for instance, [cmd: overlay-buffer].

`QSoas` supports arbitrary text flags, by passing a comma-separated
list of flags to the `/flags=` option. In the absence of that, the
buffers are flagged with the flag name `default`. Buffers can hold
an arbitrary number of flags. For instance:

~~~~
QSoas> flag 0..5 /flags=exp1,fit
~~~~

flags buffers 0 to 5 with the flags `exp1` and `fit`. Buffers are
flagged 'in-place': the current buffer is not changed.

If the `/for-which` option is present, the flags are only applied to
the datasets that match the specifications given. See more about that
[there](#for-which).

{::comment} description-start: unflag {:/}
Does the reverse of [cmd: flag], that is removes all flags on the

latter is present. The `/for-which` option words exactly in the same
way as for [cmd: flag].

This command can be used to automatically flag the datasets produced
by any command afterwards, until a call to [cmd: auto-flag] without
options:

~~~~
QSoas> auto-flag /flags=stuff
 [ ... create new datasets. They will all be flagged stuff,
 until the following command ...]
QSoas> auto-flag

Short name: `F`

  * _formula_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"}: Formula (valid Ruby code) -- values: arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance

{::comment} synopsis-end: apply-formula {:/}
{::comment} description-start: apply-formula {:/}
Applies a formula to the current dataset. It should specify how the
`x` and/or `y` values of the dataset are modified:

~~~~
QSoas> apply-formula 'x = x**2'
QSoas> apply-formula 'y = sin(x**2)'
QSoas> apply-formula 'x,y = y,x'
~~~~

The last bit swaps the $$x$$ and $$y$$ values of the buffer. The
formula must be valid [ruby](#ruby) code.

In addition to `x` and `y` (note the lowercase !), the formula can
refer to: 

  * `i`, the index of the data point
  * `seg`, the number of the current segment (starting from 0)
  * `y2`, `y3`, etc when there are more than 2 columns in the dataset

`i` and `seg` cannot be modified, but `y2` and so on can.

Extra columns initially filled with 0 can be created by using the
`/extra-columns` option:

~~~~
QSoas> apply-formula /extra-columns=1 'y2 = y**2'
~~~~

This creates a second column containing the square of the values of
the Y column.

If `/use-stats=true` is used, a global variable `$stats` can be used
within the Ruby expression that contains all the statistics displayed
by [cmd: stats]. For instance, to normalize the Y values by dividing
by the median, one would use:

~~~ 
QSoas> apply-formula /use-stats=true 'y = y/$stats["y_med"]'
~~~

Statistics by segments (see more about segments [there](#segments))
are available too, which means if you want to normalize by the medians
of the first segment, you could do

~~~ 
QSoas> apply-formula /use-stats=true 'y = y/$stats[0]["y_med"]'
~~~

If `/use-meta` is `true` (the default), then a global variable `$meta`
is defined that contains the value of the [meta-data](#meta-data)
(what is shown by [cmd: show]). What you make of this will greatly
depend of the meta-data QSoas has gathered from your file (and the
ones you may have set manually using [cmd: set-meta]).

{::comment} synopsis-end: strip-if {:/}
{::comment} description-start: strip-if {:/}
Removes all points for which the ruby expression returns `true`. This
can be used for quite advanced data selection:

~~~~
QSoas> strip-if 'x > 2'
~~~~ 

This removes all points whose X value is over 2.

~~~~
QSoas> strip-if 'x * y < 10 && x > 2'
~~~~

This removes all the points for which both the X value is over 2 and
the product of X and Y is below 10.

When reading data files that contain spurious data points (such as
text lines containing no data within a file read with
[cmd: load-as-text]), QSoas replaces the missing data
by weird numbers called NaN (Not a Number). They can be useful at
times, but mess up statistics and fits. To remove them, use:

~~~~
QSoas> strip-if '(x != x) || (y != y)'

  * `deltax` (default): the numbers are the length (in terms of X) of
    the sub-buffers
  * `xvalues`: the numbers are the X values at which to split
  * `index` (or `indices`): the numbers are the indices of the points
    at which to split

If `/set-segments` is on, the X values not used to create independent
buffers but rather to set the position of the  [segments](#segments).

{::comment} description-start: unwrap {:/}

This command makes the X values of the current buffer monotonic by
ensuring that the value of $$\Delta x$$ always have the same sign,
changing it if needs be.

This is useful for instance to convert a cyclic voltammogram from 
$$i = f(E)$$ to $$i = f(t)$$, after dividing by the scan rate.

Concatenates the buffers given as arguments, adding segment stops
inbetween (unless `/add-segments=false` is used). This can be used to
reverse the effect of the previous commands.

This does not change the number of columns. If you're trying to gather
several Y columns as a function of the same X, you should try
[cmd: contract] instead.

## Buffer's meta-data and perpendicular coordinates {#meta-data}

QSoas's buffers hold more than just columns of numbers. When a file is
loaded, QSoas also gathers as much information as possible about that
file, such as original file name, file date, and, for files supported
by QSoas, details about the experimental conditions recorded in that
file. These are known as "meta-data", and can be displayed using the
[cmd: show] command.

Here are some meta-data of particular signification available to all
buffers loaded from files:

  * `file-date` is the date of the file
  * `age` is the how old the file was in **seconds** when the current
    `QSoas` session was started.
  * `commands` is the list of commands that have been applied to this
    buffer since its load/creation.

Upon saving using [cmd: save] all of a buffer's meta-data are saved as
comments in the text file.

Perpendicular coordinates make sense when a buffer has several Y
columns. For instance, when data consists in spectra taken at
different times after the beginning of an experiment, like in the
[tutorial](tutorial.html#tuto-joliot)  (or at different
solution potentials for a redox titration), then the X values will be
the wavelength, and each Y column will correspond to a different
time. Then the time is the _perpendicular coordinate_. One can set
the perpendicular coordinate manually using [cmd: set-perp].

Many commands make use of perpendicular coordinates, most notably
[cmd: transpose] (that would convert columns of $$y = f(\lambda)$$ for
different values of $$t$$ above into columns of $$y = f(t)$$ for
different values of $$\lambda$$), and all the multi-fit commands that
show parameters as a function of the perpendicular coordinates when
applicable.

## Selecting datasets and files based on meta-data {#for-which}

Some commands, namely [cmd: flag], [cmd: unflag] and [cmd: browse]
accept a `/for-which` option to select the datasets (or files) they
work on based on their properties. The value of the `/for-which` is a
[ruby](#ruby) formula that uses the global variables `$meta` and
`$stats` variables. For instance, the following command flags all the
datasets in the stack that have a maximum value above `1e-4`:

~~~
QSoas> flag all /for-which '$stats["y_max"] >= 1e-4'
~~~

Be mindful of the quotes: the outer `'` quotes are meant to protect
the `$stats["y_max"] >= 1e-4` bit that is passed on to ruby. The
quotes around `y_max` are necessary, as `$stats` is a
[dictionnary](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html) whose keys are
ruby strings, hence the double quotes.

# Data filtering/processing

QSoas provides different ways to process data to remove unwanted
noise: 

 * Fourier transform filtering using [cmd: filter-fft]
   or [cmd: auto-filter-fft].
 * Data approximation using basis splines via 
   [cmd: filter-bsplines] or 
   [cmd: auto-filter-bs].
 * Splike removals using [cmd: remove-spikes] or even [cmd: deldp].

In addition, QSoas provides ways to remove calculated "baselines":

 * baselines interpolated from datapoints with
   [cmd: baseline]
 * baselines interpolated between two segments using either a cubic
   function or an exponential function with
   [cmd: catalytic-baseline]

{::comment} synopsis-end: filter-fft {:/}
{::comment} description-start: filter-fft {:/}
Filter data using FFT, ie the data is Fourier transformed, then a
filter function is applied in the frequency domain and the result is
backward transformed.

The cutoff can be changed using the mouse left/right buttons. The
power spectrum can be displayed using the `p` key, and the derivative
can be displayed with `d` (in which case you get the derivative of the
signal when accepting the data).

Behind the scenes, a cubic baseline is computed and subtracted from
the data to ensure that the data to which the FFT is applied has 0
value and 0 derivative on both sides. This greatly reduces artifacts
at the extremities of the dataset. This baseline is computed using a
small heuristic. You can display it using the `b` key.

{::comment} synopsis-end: filter-bsplines {:/}
{::comment} description-start: filter-bsplines {:/}

Filters the data using B-splines: B-splines are polynomial functions
of a given order defined over segments. The filtering process finds
the linear combination of these splines functions that is the closest
to the original data.

This approach amounts to taking the projection of the original data
onto the subspace of the polynomial functions.

More information about the polynomial splines used can be found in
the [GSL documentation](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Overview-of-B_002dsplines.html).  

The result can be tuned by placing "nodes", ie the X positions of the
segments over which the splines are defined. Put more nodes in an area
where the data is not described properly by the smoothed
function. Increasing the order (using `+`) may help too.

Like for [cmd: filter-fft], you can derive the data as
well pushing the `d` key.

Hitting the `o` key optimizes the position of the segments in order
to minimize the difference between the data and the
approximation. (be careful as this function may fail at times).

Draw a baseline by placing markers on the curve using the mouse (or
off the curve, after using key `o`). Baseline is computing using one
of several interpolation algorithms: C-splines, linear or polynomial
interpolation and Akima splines (the latter usually follows best the
accidents on the curve). Cycle between the various schemes by hitting
`t`.

It is possible to leave saving not the interpolated data, but just the
interpolation ``nodes'' (ie the big dots), by pushing the `p`
key. This has two advantages: first, one can load nodes from a buffer
by hitting the `L` key and providing the buffer number (or just their
X value by hitting `l`). Second, if one has the nodes and just the X
values, one can generate the interpolated data using [cmd: interpolate].

# Operations involving several buffers {#buffer-operations}

It is possible to combine several buffers into one by applying
mathematical operations (subtraction, division and the like). Each of
these processes involve matching a point in a given buffer to a point
in another buffer. There are two ways to do that, chosen by the
`/mode` option:


 * with `/mode=xvalues`, the default, uses the values of X (ie the
   closest X value is picked). **Warning** this doesn't give the
   expected result for buffers with several times the same X values,
   like cyclic voltammograms.
 * with `/mode=indices`, points are matched on a one-to-one basis, ie
   point 1 of buffer 1 to point 1 of buffer 2, irrespective of the X
   values.

In addition to that, the operations can make use of the segments
defined on each buffer (see [cmd: find-steps] and
[cmd: set-segments]). If segments are defined and
`/use-segments=true`, then the operations are applied
segment-by-segment, with the first point of each segment matching the
corresponding point in the other buffer. This mode is particularly
useful to manipulate series of potential steps with different time
intervals.

{::comment} description-start: average {:/}
In a manner similar to [cmd: subtract] and
[cmd: divide], the `average` command averages all the
buffers given into one, with the same segment-by-segment capacities.

An additional feature of `average`, though is its ability to first
split the buffers into monotonic parts before averaging (when `/split`
is on). That is even the default in the case when only one buffer is
provided. This proves useful for averaging the forward and return scan
in a cyclic voltammogram.

Merge the second buffer with the first one, and keep Y of the second
as a function of Y of the first. The algorithm for finding which point
in the second corresponds to a given one in the first is the same as
that of the other buffers. 

If more than two buffers are specified, the last one gets merged with

{::comment} synopsis-end: contract {:/}
{::comment} description-start: contract {:/}
As may be anticipated from the name, `contract` does the reverse of 
[cmd: expand], ie it regroups in one buffer several values
of Y that run against the same values of X. The result is a buffer
that contains as many Y columns as the total of Y columns of all the
arguments. X matching between the buffers is done as for the other
operations such as [cmd: div] or  [cmd: subtract].

You can specify a column list using `/use-columns` (see
[above](#column-names) for more information about column lists), in
which case the other columns from the buffers are ignored.

{::comment} description-start: find-peaks {:/}
Find all the peaks of the current dataset. Peaks are local extrema
over a window of a number of points given by `/window` (8 by default).
If `/output` is on, then the peak data is written to the output
file. This function will find many peaks on noisy data, you can limit
to the first _n_ ones by using `/peaks=`_n_ (peaks are ranked by
amplitude).

By default, if a point at either end of the dataset is an extremum, it
is not included, unless you use `/include-borders=true`.

Peaks are indicated on the buffer using lines, and their position is
written to the terminal, if `/output` is on (off by default).

`stats` displays various statistics about the current buffer (or the one
specified as the `/buffer` option). The exact list of statistics
displayed grows slowly with time and needs. It is currently, for each
column:

 * the first and last values (displayed with the index)
 * the `_min` and `_max` values
 * the average
 * `_var`, the variance
 * the `_norm`, ie the square root of the sum of the squares
 * for Y columns, the integral is also displayed, indexed by `_int`.

Statistics can be written to the output file with `/to-file=true`. If
you specify `/use-segments=true`, the statistics are also displayed
segment-by-segment (and written out to the output file if asked
for). If you want some meta-data to be written to the output file
together with the statistics, provide them as a comma-separated list
to the `/meta` option, or, alternatively, use the `/meta` option of
the [cmd: output] command.

Linear regression. Using the left and right mouse buttons, select a
region whose slope is of interest. The terminal shows the $$a$$ and $$b$$
parameters (the equation is $$ax + b$$),
and also the effective first order rate constant, ie the
$$k_{eff}$$ parameter of the equation

$$ f_0 \exp \left[-k_{eff} \, (x - x_0) \right] $$

whose first-order expansion gives the same linear approximation, ie:

$$ f_0 \times \left[1 - k_{eff} (x - x_0))\right] = a x + b$$

Using the space bar it is possible to save the values displayed in the
terminal to the [output file](#output-file).

# Fits 

QSoas was designed with a particular emphasis on fitting data. It
allows complex fits, and in particular multi-buffer fits, when
functions with shared parameters are fit to different buffers. Fits
fall into two different categories:

 * mono-buffer fits, ie fits that apply to one buffer, but that can be
   applied to several buffers at the same time with shared parameters
 * multi-buffer fits, ie fits that need at least two buffers to work

Fits can be used through several commands: for all fits there are a
`mfit-`_fit_ and a `sim-`_fit_ command, and for mono-buffer fits,
there is a `fit-`_fit_ in addition.

 * The `fit` command fits a single buffer, when the fits allows
   that. It takes no argument
 * The `mfit` command fits several buffers at the same time. It takes
   the numbers of the buffers it will work on.
 * The `sim` command takes a saved parameters file and a series of
   buffers, and pushes the data computed from the parameters on the
   stack using the X values of the buffers given as arguments (their Y
   values are not used).

In addition to these commands, QSoas provides commands to combine fits
together, to fit derivatives of the signals, and to define fits with
distributions of parameters.

All fits commands share several common options, which are detailed
here:

 * With the `/extra-parameters` option, on defines additional
   parameters to the fit, that can be used to define parameters by
   formulas
 * Passing the name of a saved parameters file to the `/parameters`
   option preloads the given parameters at the beginning of the fit.
 * The `/set-from-meta` option makes it possible to set a value of
   parameters from meta-data. For instance, running a fit with
   `/set-from-meta=v=sr` will set the value of the parameter `v` to
   the value of the meta-data `sr` (if present). Specify more of those
   by separating them with commas.
 * The `/debug` and `/debug2` options are essentially for debugging
   the fits and the fit engines, you should not need them.

Creates a new fit named _name_ based on other fits, combined through a
formula. The formula use `y1`, `y2` and so on to refer to the
fits. You specify the fit names by removing the `fit-` or `mfit-`
prefix. For instance, to fit a sum of lorentzians and gaussians, one
just has to do:

~~~
QSoas> combine-fits lg 'y1 + y2' lorentzian gaussian
~~~

This creates a new fit, `lg`, and hence three new commands, `fit-lg`,
`mfit-lg` and `sim-lg`. The fit is a sum of a
[lorentzian](#cmd-fit-lorentzian) fit (`y1`) and a
[gaussian](#cmd-fit-gaussian) fit (`y2`). The new fit shares the
options of all the original fits.

The newly-defined fit only lasts for the current session, if you need
something more persistent, consider setting up a startup file
using [cmd: startup-files].

{::comment} description-start: define-distribution-fit {:/}
Defines a new fit called _name_ based on the fit _fit_ in which the
data is the result of the integration of the original fit over a
distribution of _parameter_.

The choice for the distribution is given through the `/distribution=`
option (also available to the created fit), and is one of:

 * `gaussian`: gaussian distribution of the parameters
 * `lorentzian`: lorentzian distribution of the parameters
 * `k0`: "dispersion of interfacial rate distribution", defined by a
   uniform probability between two values for the logarithm of the
   parameter, see [Léger, _et al_, **J. Phys. Chem. B**
   2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp0265687) for more details
 * `uniform`: for a uniform probability between two values

Of course, even for theoretically infinite distributions (`gaussian`
and `lorentzian` distributions above), `QSoas` does not integrate over
the whole real axis, which is why these distributions get an extra
parameter, fixed by default, that indicates the extent of the
integration interval in dimensionless units (independent of the value
of the parameter). In principle, these values are chosen as a good
compromise between accuracy and computing time, but they can be tuned
should you need it.

Fits to the formula:

$$ \left(A_\infty + \sum_{i=1}^n A_i \exp(-(x - x_0)/\tau_i) + b\,
x\right) \exp (- k_{loss}(x - x_0))$$

$$b\,x$$ is only present if the `/slow` option is on, and $$k_{loss}$$
is not 0 only if `/loss` is on.  If `/relative` is on, the parameter
of the fit is $$\alpha_i$$ (defined by $$A_i = \alpha_i A_\infty$$)
rather than $$A_i$$. `/relative=true` should not be used to fit data
that tend to 0.

This fit is an extension of the [fit: exponential-decay] fit when the
experiment consists in several steps in which the time constants are
expected to change, but some may be common to different steps. The
steps are specified using the `/steps` option. Specifying
`/steps=0,1,0` means that there are three steps, but there are only
two distinct sets of time constants, a first one (`0`, used for step 1
and 3), and a second one (`1`, used only for step 2).


In each of the steps, the formula fitted to the data is:

$$ y(t) = I^{k(j)}\left(1 - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha^j_i \exp(-(t -
t^j_0)/\tau^{k(j)}_i) \right)\exp (- k^{k(j)}_{loss}(t - t^j_0)) \times
\alpha_j$$

Where $$j$$ is the step number, $$k(j)$$ is the number of the
corresponding time constants, $$t^j_0$$ is the beginning of the step
$$j$$, the $$\alpha^j_i$$ are the relative amplitudes of the
exponential phases, the $$I^{k(j)}$$ are the asymptotic values of
$$y(t)$$ on each step (in the absence of film loss) and $$\alpha_j$$
is defined recursively by $$\alpha_0 = 1$$ and $$\alpha_j =
\alpha_{j-1} \exp (- k^{k(j-1)}_{loss}(t^j_0 - t^{j-1}_0))$$. This is
done so as to keep track of the film loss over the whole.

## Arbitrary fits

QSoas provides ways to fit arbitrary formulas (written in
[Ruby](#ruby)) to data. While it is possible to do that on a
case-by-case basis using [cmd: fit-arb], it is also
possible to store formulas in a plain text file and load them using 
[cmd: load-fits] or define a new one using [cmd: custom-fit].

Fits _formula_ (a piece of [Ruby](#ruby) code) to the current buffer. 

Parameters are auto-detected. Some parameters are treated
specifically:

  * `x_0` and `y_0` are fixed by default and initialized to the first
    X or Y value of the buffer the fit applies to;
  * `temperature` is also fixed and set to the current
    [temperature](#cmd-temperature)
  * Using `fara` counts as using `temperature` excepted that its value is
    $$f = F/RT$$. You never get `fara` as a fit parameter.

If you often use the same formula for `fit-arb`, you should consider
using [cmd: custom-fit] or writing it in a file and
loading that file with [cmd: load-fits].

Starting from `QSoas` version 2.0, you can use the `/with=` option to
make some of the parameters dependent on time in a flexible
fashion. See [time dependent parameters](#time-dependent-parameters)
below for more information.

Same as [cmd: fit-arb], but for multiple buffers.

Using `mfit-arb`, it is possible to specify several formulas,
separated by `|`. 

If only one formula is specified, the same formula is applied to all
buffers (with, as usual, the possibility to select which parameters
are global or buffer-local).

If more than one formula is specified, the exact same number of
buffers should be supplied; the first formula applies to the first
buffer, the second formula to the second buffer, and so on... For
instance, if you run:

~~~~
QSoas> mfit-arb a*x+b|a*x+c|a*x+d 0 1 2
~~~~

Buffer 0 get fits with `a*x+b`, 1 with `a*x+c` and 2 with `a*x+d`.

In this specific case, though, you could also have run

~~~~
QSoas> mfit-arb a*x+b 0 1 2
~~~~

and have `a` common to all buffer, but `b` buffer-specific.

Load fits of arbitrary functions from a plain text file, and create
the corresponding `fit-`, `mfit-` and `sim-` functions, that can be
used with [cmd: define-derived-fit] or
[cmd: combine-fits] for instance. Files should look
like this:

~~~~
# Comments are allowed
michaelis: vmax/(1 + km/x)
sigm-log: log((exp(a_red*log(10.0)) +exp(a_ox*log(10.0)) * \
          exp(-fara*(x-e0)))/ \
          (1 + exp(-fara*(x-e0))))

## Peak fits

The fits in this section can be used to fit various "peaks" obeying to
different distributions, such as the

 * gaussian distribution [cmd: fit-gaussian]
 * lorentzian distribution [cmd: fit-lorentzian]

For all these fits, you can specify the number of "peaks" using a
common `/number` option. For each peak, there is a position, an
amplitude and a width parameter. If you are more interested in the
total surface under the peak rather than the amplitude of the peak,
the fits provide a `/use-surface` argument that changes the amplitude
parameter into a surface one.

Fits the absorbance (or anything else) of a number of chemical species
present under several redox states as a function of the potential,
using the Nernst equation. The number of species is given to the
`/species` option, while the number of redox states for each species
is given to the `/states` option. Alternatively, if you need distinct
species with a different number of redox states, you can specify a
comma-separated list of number of states to `/states`, in which case
`/species` is ignored. For instance, to fit two species, one presentin
4 redox states and the other in two redox states, one can use:

~~~
QSoas> fit-nernst /states=4,2
~~~

The species are designated using a lowercase letter suffix, while the
redox state is designated using `red`, `int` or `ox` when there are 3
states or less, or with a number for more than three states.

**Note**: be aware that if there is more than one species, the system
is intrinsically overdetermined, which is why `QSoas` automatically
fixs the absorbance of the reduced species of all but the first one to
0 (but you can change that).

This fit is useful to fit the results of a the redox titration at a
single wavelength. If several wavelength are available, separate them
into several buffers as a function of the potential and fit them using
[cmd: mfit-nernst], while keeping the redox potentials
(and electron numbers) global and only the absorbances as
buffer-local.

Fits a series of "ideal adsorbed peaks" to the current buffer. The
actual formula is the following:

$$ i = \frac{F^2 \nu }{R\,T} 
   \left( \sum_{k} i^{1~el}_k + \sum_{k'} i^{2~el}_{k'}\right) 
$$

The number of 1-electron peaks is given by the `/species` option
(defaults to 1) and that of the 2-electrons peaks is given by the
`/2el` option (defaults to 0).

The current for 1-electron peaks is given by:

$$ i^{1~el}_k = \frac{\Gamma_k n_k\,e_k}{\left(1 + {e_k}\right)^2}
$$ 

with $$e_k = \exp \frac{F\,n_k (E - E^0_k)}{R\,T}$$, with $$E^0_k$$
the potential of the couple and $$n_k$$ the apparent number of
electrons. The latter only affects the width of the peaks, the
stoechiometry is always 1 electron.

The current for the 2-electrons peaks is given by [Pilchon and
Laviron, __J. Electronanal. Chem.__,
*1976*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0728(76)80030-7):

$$ i^{2~el}_{k'} = \Gamma_{k'} \kappa_{k'}
\frac{\epsilon_{k'} + 4/\kappa_{k'} + 1/\epsilon_{k'}}
{\left(\epsilon_{k'} + \kappa_{k'} + 1/\epsilon_{k'}\right)^2}
$$

With $$\epsilon_{k'} = \exp \frac{F\,(E - E^0_{k'})}{R\,T}$$,
$$E^0_{k'}$$ being the 2-electrons reduction potential (i.e. the
average of those of the 1-electron couples) and 
$$\kappa_{k'} = \exp \frac{F\,\Delta E^0_{k'}}{R\,T}$$, 
$$\Delta E^0_{k'}$$ being the
difference in the reduction potentials of the 1-electron couples (it
is positive if the intermediate species is thermodynamically stable).

The $$\Gamma$$ parameters are the number of moles of the molecules
adsorbed on the electrode (there is no explicit surface). If the
option `/distinct=false` is used, the same value of $$\Gamma$$ is used
for all couples, while in the other case (the default), each couple
has its own value of $$\Gamma$$ (which corresponds to unrelated
species). $$\nu$$ is the voltammetric scan rate (in volts per second).

Using this command, one can fit the results of integrating a system of
differential equations (as with the command [cmd: ode]) to a
dataset. The system is a file given as the _system_ argument. For more
details, please refer to the documentation of the [cmd: ode]
command. The parameters whose values are not defined in the _system_
file become the fit parameters. If there is no optional third section
in the _system_ file, the $$y$$ value of the function is by default
a linear combination of the variables of the system.

As with the [fit: kinetic-system] fit, some of the parameters of the
system can be varied automatically as a function of time, using the
`/with=` option. See [time dependent
parameters](#time-dependent-parameters) below for more information.

## Kinetic systems {#kinetic-systems}

It is possible with QSoas to fit kinetic traces that follow the
concentration of one or more species that are part of a full kinetic
system. For that, you need to write a simple [text file](#text-files) of the
following form:

~~~~
A <=>[k_i][k_a] I1
I1 ->[k_i2 * o2] I2
~~~~

This describes a kinetic system with three species, `A`, `I1` and
`I2`, with a reversible reaction from `A` to `I1` with a forward
rate of `k_i` and a backward rate of `k_a`, and an irreversible
reaction from `I1` to `I2` with a rate of `k_i2 * o2`. 

The files can contain comment lines starting with a `#`, and can
contain an arbitrary large number of reactions.

QSoas automatically detects the parameters from the fit, here `k_i`,
`k_a`, `k_i2` and `o2`, and the initial concentrations of `A`, `I1`
and  `I2`, namely `c0_A`, `c0_I1` and `c0_I2`.

It is possible to assign special time dependence to any of the
parameters by using the `/with` option: 

~~~~
QSoas> fit-kinetic-system /with=o2:3,exp kinetic-file.txt
~~~~

This gives to `o2` the value of the sum of three exponential decays
shifted in time (see formula below); this possibility is documented in
greater detail [below](#time-dependent-parameters). 

To define a new fit one could combine with others using 
[cmd: combine-fits], use [cmd: define-kinetic-system-fit].

In the [cmd: fit-kinetic-system] fit, one has to provide
systematically the name of the file that contains the kinetic system.
This can be annoying at times, and it makes it impossible to use these
fits with [cmd: combine-fits] or [cmd: define-derived-fit].

This command makes it possible to define a new fit for the kinetic
system contained in _file_. The kinetic system is read once: further
changes in the file will **not** be taken into account.

## Time-dependent parameters {#time-dependent-parameters}

Some fits, namely [fit: arb], [fit: ode] and [fit: kinetic-system]
(and all the custom fits defined using [cmd: custom-fit] or 
[cmd: define-kinetic-system-fit]) have a built-in possibility to have
some parameters depend on time (instead of being constant). For
instance, this possibility can be used in kinetic systems to impose an
external dependence on various parameters: maybe a rate constant will
only have a non-zero value during a given period of time, in the case
of a light-dependent process, or another parameter is modulated
sinusoidally...

The time-dependent parameters are defined using the `/with=` option to
the fits. This option takes a `;`-separated list of specifications of
the form: _parameter_:_number_,_type_,_options_... where _parameter_
is the name of the parameter that will depend on time, _type_ is the
type of the dependence (see below), _number_ (not always needed) is
the number of "features" in the dependence (very type-dependent), and
_options_ can additionnally be used for some types.


`QSoas` recognizes the following time-dependences:

  * `exp`, where the given parameter, $$p$$ is given by:

  $$ p = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \exp \left( - \frac{t -
  t^p_i}{\tau^p_i}\right) \times H(t - t^p_i)$$

  where $$H$$ is the heavyside step function (1 for positive argument,
  0 else) and $$n$$ is the number given just after `:` (in command
  below, that means you will have three different steps). You may wish
  to have all $$\tau$$ values common, which you do by adding `,common`
  in the spec:

~~~~
QSoas> fit-kinetic-system /with=o2:3,exp,common kinetic-file.txt
~~~~

  This kind of functions were used to analyse the inhibition of NiFe
  hydrogenase by CO and O2, see for instance [Liebgott _et al_,
  __Nat. Chem. Biol.__, 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.276).

  * `steps`, where the given parameter, takes a series of values (1
  more than the _number_ given) at the given times.
  * `rexp`, that combines the `steps` and `exp`: the time is divided
  in _number_ segments (preceded by an initial segment in which the
  parameter is fixed) in which the parameter is given by:

  $$ p = \left(p(t = t_i) - p^i_{\infty}\right)\exp -\frac{t -
  t_i}{\tau_i} \qquad\text{for}\qquad t_i < t \leq t_{i+1} $$

  As for `exp`, the time constant can be chosen to be common to all
  the segments by adding `,common` after the spec.



Another way to look at the different types of time-dependent
parameters available in your version of `QSoas` is to run the file
`make-all.cmds` from the `tests/time-dependent-parameters` directory
of the [source code archive][code].



## Slow scans fits

These specific fits were used in the context of the interpretation of
cyclic voltammograms of adorbed nickel-iron hydrogenase that undergo
inactivations under oxidizing conditions. For more information, refer
to [Abou-Hamdam _et al_, **PNAS** 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1212258109)
(which you probably should cite anyway if you use them).

Fit for the "high-potential" part of a slow voltammetric scan where
inactivation occurs with rate constants that do not depend on
time. The current for the active form is assumed to depend linearly on
the potential.

Formula:

$$ i_{forward} = (a + b \times E) \left[\left(A_1 - A_e\right) \times \exp\left\{-(E E_1)/(\nu \tau)\right\} + A_e\right]  $$

$$ i_{backward} = (a + b \times E) \left[\left(A_1 - A_e\right) \times \exp\left\{-(2E_v-E_1-E)/(\nu \tau)\right\} + A_e\right]  $$

where $$E_v$$ is the vertex potential, $$E_1$$ is the initial potential,
$$\tau$$ the rate constant of decrease, $$A_1$$ the amount of initially
active enzyme, $$A_e$$ the equilibrium concentration of active species
and $\nu$ the scan rate.

## Wave shape fits

These fits correspond to the various models described in 
[Fourmond _et al_, **JACS** 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja311607s):

 * [cmd: fit-eecr-wave] is the *EEC* model
 * [cmd: fit-ecr-wave] is the *EC* model
 * [cmd: fit-eecr-relay-wave] is the *EECR*
   model

Please refer to that paper for more information.

Fits the so-called EEC model in [Fourmond _et al_, **JACS** 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja311607s) 
to the data.

If `/plateau` is off (default), then the equation used is that for the
limit where the dispersion of values of $$k_0$$ 
large $$\beta d_0 \to \infty$$, while the full expression is used in
the other case.

If `/oxidation` is true, the reference current is the oxidation current
(and not the reduction current as is the default).

If `/use-eoc` is true, then the open circuit potential is used as a
parameter rather than the ratio $$k_2/k_{-2}$$.

# Computation/simulations functions

The commands in this section generate data "from scracth", though most
require a buffer to work on, to act as a model for the X values. You
can create a buffer for those commands using
[cmd: generate-buffer]. 

## Evaluation functions

While it is not its primary purpose, QSoas provides various functions
to evaluate the result of mathematical operations.

{::comment} synopsis-start: eval {:/}

### eval - Ruby eval {#cmd-eval}

`eval` _code_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"}

  * _code_{:title="arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance"}: Any ruby code -- values: arbitrary text. If you need spaces, do not forget to quote them with ', for instance

{::comment} synopsis-end: eval {:/}
{::comment} description-start: eval {:/}
Evaluates the given code as a Ruby expression:

~~~~
QSoas> eval 2*3
 => 6
~~~~

It runs in the same environment as the
[cmd: apply-formula] and the custom fits (excepted,
of course, that there are no `x` and `y` variables). It can be useful
to check that a function has been correctly defined in a file loaded
by [cmd: ruby-run]. You can also use that as a calculator.

{::comment} description-start: find-root {:/}

Find the root of the given `x`-dependent expression using an iterative
algorithm, using _seed_ as the initial value. If the `/max` option is
specified, then the search proceeds using dichotomy between the two
values (_seed_ and _max_).

~~~~
QSoas> find-root 'x**2 - 3' 1
Found root at: 1.73205

Do not use a equal sign. The returned value is that for which the
expression equates 0.

{::comment} synopsis-end: kinetic-system {:/}
{::comment} description-start: kinetic-system {:/}
Simulates the evolution over time of the [kinetic
system](#kinetic-systems) given in the _reaction-file_ (see the
section [kinetic system](#kinetic-systems) for the syntax of the
reaction files).

This commands will use the current buffer as a source for X values. 

The result is a multi-column buffer containing the concentration of
all the species in the different columns.

_parameters_ is a list of assignments evaluated at the beginning of the
time evolution to set the parameters of the system. (all parameters
not set this way default to 0). This list is evaluated as
[Ruby](#ruby) code, so you should separate the assignments with `;`.

For instance, if the reaction file (`system.sys`) contains:

~~~
A <=>[ki][ka] I
~~~

You can run the following commands to simulate the time evolution of
the system with initial concentration of A equal to 1 (the parameter
`c0_A`), of I equal to 0 (the parameter `c0_I`, here not specified so
assumed to be 0) and with `ki` and `ka` equal to 1:

~~~
QSoas> generate-buffer 0 10
QSoas> kinetic-system system.sys 'c0_A = 1;ka = 1; ki = 1'
~~~

The _parameters_ argument is actually a [Ruby](#ruby) expression that
is evaluated once before the computations start, so you can use more
complex formulas.

`ode` solves ordinary differential equations. The equation definition
file is structure in three parts, separated by at least one fully
blank line, the last one being optional. 

The first section defines the "initial conditions"; there are as many
integrated variables as there are lines in this section. This section
is only evaluated at the beginning of the system.

The second section defines the derivatives; they are evaluated several
times for each time step. 

Here is the contents of the file (say `sine.ode`) one would use to
obtain $$\sin t$$ and $$\cos t$$ as solutions.

~~~
sin = 0
cos = 1

d_sin = cos
d_cos = -sin
~~~

After running the commands

~~~
QSoas> generate-buffer 0 10
QSoas> ode sine.ode
~~~

One has a buffer with one X column (representing the $$t$$ values),
and two Y columns, $$\sin t$$ and $$\cos t$$ (in the order in which
they are given in the "initial conditions" section).

The optional third section can be used to control the exact output of
the program. The above example can be completed thus:

~~~
sin = 0
cos = 1

d_sin = cos
d_cos = -sin

[sin, cos, sin**2 + cos**2]
~~~

Using this gives 3 Y columns: $$\sin t$$, $$\cos t$$ and 
$$\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t$$, that should hopefully be very close to 1.

Details of the integrations procedures can be tweaked using the
parameters:

 * `/stepper`: the ODE stepper algorithm. You can find more about them
   in the [GSL documentation](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Stepping-Functions.html)
 * `/prec-relative` and `/prec-absolute` control the precision. A step
   will be deemed precise enough if the error estimate is **either**
   smaller than the relative precision or than the absolute precision
 * `/adaptive` controls whether an adaptative step size is used (the
   values of $$t$$ in the resulting buffer are always those asked, but
   there may be more intermediate steps). You should seldom need to
   turn it off

If `/annotate` is on, a last column is added that contains the number
of the evaluations of derivatives for each step (useful for
understanding why an integration takes so long, for instance).

The system of equations may contain undefined variables; one could
have for instance used:

~~~
d_sin = omega * cos
d_cos = -omega * sin
~~~

Their values are set to 0 by default. You can change their values
using the `/parameters` option:

~~~
QSoas> ode sine.ode /parameters="omega = 3"
~~~

# Scripting facilities {#scripting}

QSoas provides facilities for scripting, ie running commands
unattended, for instance for preparing series of data files for
fitting or further use. There are a few commands useful only in this
context, such as the following


## Scripting commands

{::comment} synopsis-start: run {:/}

### run - Run commands {#cmd-run}

`run` _file..._{:title="one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc..."} `/silent=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"} `/add-to-history=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}

Short name: `@`

  * _file..._{:title="one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc..."}: First is the command files, following are arguments -- values: one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc...
  * `/silent=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: Whether or not display is updated during the load -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`
  * `/add-to-history=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: Whether the commands run are added to the history (defaults to false) -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`

{::comment} synopsis-end: run {:/}
{::comment} description-start: run {:/}
Run commands saved in a file. If a compulsory argument is missing,
QSoas will prompt the user.

Arguments following the name of the script are passed to the script as
"special variables" `${1}`, and `${2}` etc.

Imagine you are often doing the same processing a given type of data
files, say, simply filtering them. You just have to write a script
`process.cmd` containing:

~~~~
load ${1}
auto-filter-fft 
~~~~

And run it this way:

~~~~
QSoas> @ process.cmd data_file.dat
~~~~

If you start to use `run` regularly, you may be interested in the
other scripting commands, such as [cmd: run-for-each],
[cmd: run-for-datasets] and
[cmd: startup-files]

{::comment} description-end: run {:/}


{::comment} synopsis-start: startup-files {:/}

### startup-files - Startup files {#cmd-startup-files}

`startup-files` `/add=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/rm=`_integer_{:title="an integer"} `/run=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}

  * `/add=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} (default option): Adds the given startup file -- values: path of a file
  * `/rm=`_integer_{:title="an integer"}: Removes the numbered file -- values: an integer
  * `/run=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}: If on, runs all the startup files right now -- values: a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`

{::comment} synopsis-end: startup-files {:/}
{::comment} description-start: startup-files {:/}
Using this command, you can instruct `QSoas` to execute command files
at startup. Without options, this command displays the list of command
files that `QSoas` will read at the next startup.

Files given to the `/add` options are added at the end of the list.

To remove a fil from the list, obtain its number by running
startup-fileswithout any option, then use
startup-files again with the option /rm=.

You can re-run all startup files by running:

~~~
QSoas> startup-files /run=true
~~~

{::comment} synopsis-start: run-for-each {:/}

### run-for-each - Runs a script for several arguments {#cmd-run-for-each}

`run-for-each` _script_{:title="path of a file"} _arguments..._{:title="one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc..."} `/arg2=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/arg3=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/arg4=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/arg5=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/arg6=`_file_{:title="path of a file"} `/range-type=`_choice_{:title="one of: `lin`, `log`"} `/silent=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"} `/add-to-history=`_yes-no_{:title="a boolean: `yes`, `on`, `true` or `no`, `off`, `false`"}

  * _script_{:title="path of a file"}: The script file -- values: path of a file
  * _arguments..._{:title="one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc..."}: All the arguments for the script file to loop on -- values: one or more files. Can include wildcards such as *, `[0-4]`, etc...
  * `/arg2=`_file_{:title="path of a file"}: Second argument to the script -- values: path of a file

{::comment} synopsis-end: run-for-each {:/}
{::comment} description-start: run-for-each {:/}
Runs the given script file successively for each argument given. For
instance, running:

~~~
QSoas> run-for-each process-my-file.cmds file1 file2 file3
~~~

Is equivalent to running successively

~~~
QSoas> @ process-my-file.cmds file1 
QSoas> @ process-my-file.cmds file2
QSoas> @ process-my-file.cmds file3
~~~

The arguments may not be file names, although automatic completion
will only complete file names. If the script you want to run requires
more than one argument, you can specify them (for all the runs) using
the options `/arg2`, `/arg3` and so on:

~~~
QSoas> run-for-each process-my-file.cmds /arg2=other file1 file2 
~~~

Is equivalent to running:

~~~
QSoas> @ process-my-file.cmds file1 other
QSoas> @ process-my-file.cmds file2 other
~~~

If you specify either `/range-type=lin` or `/range-type=log`, the
parameters are interpreted differently, and are expected to be of the
type `1..10:20`, which means 20 numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive),
that are spaced either linearly or logarithmically, depending on the
value of the option.

## Ruby code {#ruby}

QSoas internally uses [Ruby][ruby] for the interpretation of all
formulas. This means in particular that all formulas must be valid
ruby code.

Basically, the [Ruby][ruby] syntax ressembles that of other symbolic
evaluation programs (it is quite close to the one from
[gnuplot][gnuplot]), with the following restrictions: 

 * Parameter names **cannot start with an uppercase letter**, as those have a
   special meaning to the Ruby interpreter: anything that starts with
   an uppercase letter is assumed to be a constant.
 * Don't abbreviate floating point numbers: `2.` and `.4` are invalid, use
   `2.0` and `0.4` instead.
 * **Case matters**: `Pi` is $$\pi$$, while `pi` is nothing defined.

In addition to standard mathematical functions from the [Math][math]
module (that contains, among others, the error function
[`erf`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Math.html#method-c-erf) and
the
[`gamma`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Math.html#method-c-gamma)
function), the following special functions are available:

{::comment} special-functions-start {:/}
