Compilation requires the following packages:

  * The Qt library. QSoas works well with both Qt4 and Qt5
  * The mruby interpreter, from https://mruby.org/. The problem with
    mruby is QSoas will compile fine with version 1.3.0, but a bug in
    the mruby interpreter will cause a crash. You need a version
    between commits 7450a774 and afa5380, or posterior to
    55431b4. Grab them from https://github.com/mruby/mruby
  * Any Ruby interpreter (you don't need the development files, ruby
    is only used to prepare the build, it is not used to build
    against)
  * The GSL libraries, from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/,  both
    versions 1.16 and 2.1 are supported
  

On mac and linux computers, just running

  ./configure

and

  make

should do the trick.

If you use a custom build of mruby, not installed in the standard
library search paths, you need to specify it to ./configure

  MRUBY_DIR=/path/to/mruby/dir ./configure

On windows, that should do the trick too, provided the GSL, Qt and
Ruby libraries are in a place where the linker can find it.
