# Fits

## Can QSoas be used to fit a model that is calculated with an external program? Like EasySpin or Matlab?

This is not possible at the moment, but we are currently designing a
generic interface for using external programs to compute
datasets. This would make it possible to fit using results of
computations done within Matlab for instance, such as Easyspin.

## How can I export "clean" version of the fit data ?

The simplest way is to use "Data..."/"Push current to stack" function
from the fit window, that will push the simulated curve to the
stack. You can save it later using the [cmd: save] command.

However, if you don't have so many data points, but you would like to
have a "smooth" curve nevertheless, save the fit parameters, generate
a buffer with the desired range of $$x$$ values using
[cmd: generate-buffer], respawn the fit window, load the parameters
and then export as before ("Data..."/"Push current to stack").

## My multi-fit is way too slow...

Fitting many datasets with parameters in common is quite an expensive
task. At the beginning of the fit, QSoas says the number of free
parameters for the fit. The time taken by the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm used by most of the fit engines scales as the cube of the
number of parameters. This is a limitation that cannot be overcome
easily.

If you are fitting kinetics or redox titrations at many wavelengths,
try reducing the number of wavelengths by applying [cmd: downsample]
before running [cmd: transpose].

# File formats

## Can QSoas read any file ?

No. But, it can read essentially all text files, which all data
acquisition programs generate via their ``export to ASCII'' or
``export to CSV''. QSoas should detect automatically the format of
those files, but if it does not, have a look at the command
[cmd: load-as-text] for specifying the things QSoas did not manage to
guess.

## I use GPES, can QSoas read the ixw (not oxw) file?

QSoas makes use of the information files generated by GPES (for
chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry only, i.e. the `.ixw` and
`.icw` files). See the data QSoas could find using the [cmd: show]
command.

## Can I use QSoas to read NOVA files?

NOVA produces large opaque binary files whose format is not
public. This is the reason why QSoas cannot read them (although that
may change if the format specs are published). If you want to process
the data with QSoas (or any other software than NOVA !), you have to
export the data to ASCII, either after the experiment, or even by
including an "Export to ASCII" command in the experiment setup.

## How can I load EC-Lab ASCII files

EC-Lab ASCII files are essentially semicolon-delimited CSV files. Look
for a line in the spirit of

~~~~
mode;error;time/s;Ewe/V
~~~~

This shows that it is a $$E = f(t)$$ data file, that $$t$$ is the
3rd column, and $$E$$ the 4th one, and that the separator is indeed
`;`. Try to load it using

~~~~
l ocp_C02.csv /separator=; /columns=3,4
~~~~

Don't forget the `/decimal=,` option if you are using French decimal
separator.


## Help, QSoas doesnâ€™t read my files !

What if load a file and you don't see anything at all, or data that
really don't look like yours ? QSoas tries to be smart and find under
which format are stored data files, but it does not always guess
right.

First, make sure the file data is a text file, i.e. open it with a
text editor. If you see numbers that look like your data, it is a text
file, if all you see is nonsensical symbols, what you have is a binary
file. Go back to the software that produced it, reload it, and look
for ``Export as Text/ASCII'' functions.

If you see the numbers, guess the structures: what is the decimal
separator ? What is the column separator ? What are the columns you're
actually interested in ? The decimal separator can be set using the
`/decimal=` option to [cmd: load], the column separator using the
`/separator=` option. You can specify the columns using the
`/columns=` option. By default, [cmd: load] ignores lines that look
like text -- that don't start with a number. You can turn that off by
setting `/comment=#` (to only ignore lines that start with a `#`).

You can get an idea of how `QSoas` read the file by launching the
[cmd: edit] command.


# Using QSoas

## Why can't I copy text from the terminal window ?

Keyboard shortcuts are disactivated in the terminal window (so that
they always work in the command-line prompt), but if you select text
in the terminal window and right-click on it, you'll have the
possibility to copy to the clipboard.

# Help !

## Where can I get help ?

First, try looking at the [tutorial][tuto], peruse the [FAQ][faq] and
read the [documentation][doc]. If that doesn't solve your problems,
you can ask your question in the [forums][forums].

# Copyright

## I have just bought QSoas, can I give it to my friends? How do you expect to make money if the program is not protected? 

QSoas is distributed under the [GNU General Public license version
2.0][gpl], which means among other things that you can redistribute
the binaries so long as you can provide the source code for them.

While you can get the binaries legally for free from a friend, think
about it. Buying the fairly inexpensive binaries help the development
of QSoas, and hence is a gift from you to the whole community of users
of QSoas.


## Why on earth do I have to pay for a free program ?

Well, you don't have to pay. You can grab the source code from the
[download page][downloads] and compile it from the source; actually
this is the only supported way to get the program under
Linux. However, if you want to be spared the hassle to compile the
application yourself, you can buy the pre-built binaries, and feel
good because you are contributing to the further development of QSoas !

# Bugs, updates

## I believe I found a bug, can I report it? Can I get my money back?

The best way to report a bug is to signal it on the
[sourceforge bug page][bugs]. Before reporting, first check the
[documentation][doc] and the [FAQ][faq] if the behaviour really is a
problem, and then check if it has not been reported before in the
[bugs page][bugs].

Please include all information necessary to reproduce the bug, such as
what you exactly did, what you got, what you expected to get, the
exact version of QSoas and the output on the terminal when
applicable. If data confidentiality is not a problem, consider sending
a binary stack saved using [cmd: save-stack].

We don't offer refunds -- the license explicitly states that:

> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
> WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
> MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

However, if the information you provide us helps us identify and fix
the bug, we'll try to provide you with an updated version.

## I have bought QSoas 1.0, will I need to pay again each time a new version is released?

You purchased a single binary. Later versions are not included in the
price. Consider the price of QSoas: most of the softwares that are
orders of magnitudes more expensive than QSoas do not include updates
either in the purchasing cost.

## Why isn't there a win64 binary version ? Will there ever be one ?

At the moment, we cannot provide binaries for Win64, as one of the
main dependences of QSoas, [Qt](http://qt-project.org) is rather
delicate to compile under Win64 (and it is not officially supported
there either). But, don't despair, this task is reasonably close to
the top of our TODO-list.

# Data analysis

## How can I cut out data points from a buffer ?

Depends what you want to do. If you want to manually remove a few
points, try [cmd: deldp]. If you want to cut out a whole segment, try
rather [cmd: cut], hitting the `u` key to keep what's outside of the
region instead of what's inside. You can remove repeatedly segments
with the `r` key in cut. Another completely different approach is the
use of [cmd: strip-if]: to remove all data points with negative values
of `y`, try:

~~~
QSoas> strip-if y<0
