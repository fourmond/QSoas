# OK, this file is not really a test suite file, but it is helpful in general
# It takes two arguments:
# * ${1}: a Laplace formula
# * ${2}: the reverse transform
# It runs the reverse Laplace for all the steps and assess the precision

# This small subscript checks a Laplace transform against the
# theoretical formula
# ${1}: the number of steps
# ${2}: Laplace formula
# ${3}: the inverse
