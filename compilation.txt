Compilation requires the following packages:

  * The Qt library. QSoas works well with both Qt4 and Qt5
  * The mruby interpreter, from https://mruby.org/. You need version
    1.4.1, to be downloaded from there:
    https://github.com/mruby/mruby/archive/1.4.1.zip
    Earlier and later versions do not work (although version 2.0
    almost works, to the point that most users won't notice it)
  * Any Ruby interpreter (you don't need the development files, ruby
    is only used to prepare the build, it is not used to build
    against)
  * The GSL libraries, from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/, 
    versions 1.16 until 2.5 are supported
  

On mac and linux computers, just running

  ./configure

and

  make

should do the trick.

If you use a custom build of mruby, not installed in the standard
library search paths, you need to specify it to ./configure

  MRUBY_DIR=/path/to/mruby/dir ./configure

On windows, that should do the trick too, provided the GSL, Qt and
Ruby libraries are in a place where the linker can find it.
